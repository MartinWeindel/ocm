- <code>dir</code>

  The path must denote a directory relative to the resources file, which is packed
  with tar and optionally compressed
  if the <code>compress</code> field is set to <code>true</code>. If the field
  <code>preserveDir</code> is set to true the directory itself is added to the tar.
  If the field <code>followSymLinks</code> is set to <code>true</code>, symbolic
  links are not packed but their targets files or folders.
  With the list fields <code>includeFiles</code> and <code>excludeFiles</code> it is 
  possible to specify which files should be included or excluded. The values are
  regular expression used to match relative file paths. If no inlcudes are specified
  all file not explicitly excluded are used.`
